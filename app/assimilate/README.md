# K5W8S; An exclusive decentralised cloud computing platform

## Overview 
Let K5W.ai be a public server, which nodes may join. Once a node has been verified, with the client K5W application installed, the user is provided access to K5W's proposal system, and is rewarding with `W8S`, symbol ⵣ; a crypto-currency which is pegged to the value of 1GB VRAM per Hour, GBVRAM/h. Currently, the lower bound for public GPU-enabled computation platforms is 0.2$ for GBVRAM/h. Hence, if the value of W8S is maintained at around 1ⵣ ≈ 0.1$, their is an incentive to collect W8S/ⵣ since they provide you with more GBVRAM/h when compared to $ amount. 

Let the assimilated nodes be rewarded 1*(cluster_usage_factor) W8S per hour (let cluster_usage_factor ∈ (0.8,1.4), this range is dependent on the [tokenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenomics) of the platform ). 

## Purpose 
In this context, K5W.ai can be used a personal development environment or decentralised cloud-computing platform, specifically designed for researching, developing and hosting deep learning models. The incentive is to be rewarding in W8S for supplying GPU-enable compute resources, and allow contributors to either make use of the network with their earned W8S, accessing more GPU nodes than they could with their personal machine, or sell them to others who which to use the network. The principal is that at a cost of 1 W8S per GBVRAM/h of compute, it is cheaper to use W8S and K5W than any other cloud-provide with fiat currency. 

## Assimilation process 

1) Introduction process: User install K5W client, a private and public key is generated, with the public key posted to the introduction server. The node is monitored for 2 days by network, during process, User is provided access to K5w.ai dashboard showing their own nodes GPU usage. Once the introduction process if over, the user is provided access to K5W proposal system, begin to be award W8S, and can cast votes in the proposal system. 

2) Verification process: To ensure the node is available continuously, a verification process continuously runs, per hour, where the node is given a mini computational problem to solve, based on having solved this problem, they are rewarded W8S. They continuously availability is monitoring, and every consecutive verified solve problem, increases their W8S rewarding. That is, say the node has consecutively solved 24 challenges, (a days worth), let their W8S reward factor their reliability into the reward system. Furthermore, let node which provides more than one GPU to the network, have a gpu_cluster_factor, which also increases their hourly reward.

3) Voting system: A user is first provided with 20 votes they can caste day, which are reset daily, and are allow to generate 1 proposal every 3 days to the network.

4) Public versus private executions: Let users of the platform
