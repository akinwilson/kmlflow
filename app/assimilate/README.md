# W8S

![]( img/w8s.png 'decentralised deep learning' )


## Overview 
Consider K5W.ai an exclusive community researching, developing and deploying deep learning applications via a decentralised high-performance compute cluster,  being decentralised anyone with the hardware requirements may join and earning, develop of exploring the community. Once a node has been verified, with the client K5W application installed, the user is provided access to K5W's proposal system, and is rewarding with `W8S`, symbol `ⵣ`; a crypto-currency which is pegged to the value of 1GB VRAM per Hour, GBVRAM/h. Currently, the lower bound for public GPU-enabled computation platforms is 0.2$ for GBVRAM/h. Hence, if the value of W8S is maintained at around 1ⵣ ≈ 0.1$, their is an incentive to collect W8S/ⵣ since they provide you with more GBVRAM/h when compared to $ amount. 


Let the assimilated nodes be rewarded base of 1 W8S per hour. Let where network-related factors like *productivity* ∈ (0.8,1.4) influence this baseline reward amongst other factors. These factors and their definition will make of the [tokenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenomics) of the platform. 

## Purpose 
In this context, K5W.ai can be used a personal development environment or decentralised cloud-computing platform, specifically designed for researching, developing and hosting deep learning models. The incentive is to be rewarding in W8S for supplying GPU-enable compute resources, and allow contributors to either make use of the network with their earned W8S, accessing more GPU nodes than they could with their personal machine, or sell them to others who which to use the network. The principal is that at a cost of 1 W8S per ***GBVRAM/h*** of compute, their is an incentive to acquire and use W8S with the service provider of K5W, over  other cloud-provide using fiat currency. Hence, if configured correctly, K5W could be a autonomously organising network bounded and made  by the W8S tokens /  ⵣ currency. 

## Tokenomics 

Although touched upon slightly here, see a thorough  break down of the economics [here]( tokenomics/README.md). 

## Joining the network 

### Assimilation process 

1) Introduction process: User install K5W client, a private and public key is generated, with the public key posted to the introduction server. The node is monitored for 2 days by network, during process, User is provided access to K5w.ai dashboard showing their own nodes GPU usage. Once the introduction process if over, the user is provided access to K5W proposal system, begin to be award W8S, and can cast votes in the proposal system. 

2) Polling process: To ensure the node is available continuously, a polling process periodically (hourly) runs where the `Node` is given a mini computational problem to solve, based on having solved this problem, they are rewarded W8S'. Their consecutive completion of the contested challenge generated by the `Validator`  is monitoring, and with their increased streak in solving problems, a factor *consequtivity* factor, increases their periodically rewarded W8S'. Furthermore, let `Node`s which provide more than one GPU on one node to the network, have a *agminatity* factor, which rewards high numbers of GPUs per node. 

Technical side of how the `Node`s challenged and rewarded, surrounds the field of [Lattice-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography) linear algebra and to some extent its application in cryptography, particularly relying on the homophobic [commit scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme)

3) Voting system: A user is first provided with 20 votes they can caste day, which are reset daily, and are allow to generate 1 proposal every 3 days to the network.

4) Public versus private executions: Let users of the platform
